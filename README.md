# Portfolio Page Challenge

## Description
### Project Detail
- I was given the task of building from scratch a personal portfolio of work to showcase my skills and talents to potential employers.
- The page highlights my strongest work linking to deployed web applications.
- The site has been developed using the core skills I've recently learned: grids, flexbox, media queries and CSS variables.
- The page presents my name, an avatar and links to to the following sections:
  - About
  - Projects
  - Contact links
- There is a navigation menu that is fixed to the top of the page. The links in the navigation scroll to the corresponding section when clicked.
- The work section contains titled images of your applications with the first application's image displaying larger in size than the others.
- When images of the applications are clicked the user is taken to that deployed application.
- The site is responsive and when the page is resized, or viewed on various screens / devices, it adapts to the user viewport.
- The site contains a bar chart displaying the percentage of various coding languages that have been utilised in my projects (***NB. I am unable to share the VBA projects as they contain sensitive information***)
